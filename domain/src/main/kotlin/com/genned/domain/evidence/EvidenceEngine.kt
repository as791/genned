/**
 * Turns independent [DetectionSignal]s into one [AnalysisResult]. This is the one
 * place score-blending policy lives — providers never combine their own evidence with
 * anyone else's, and the UI never sees raw provider output.
 *
 * Two modes, chosen automatically:
 * 1. **Verified provenance available**: if a [SignalType.CONTENT_CREDENTIALS] signal is
 *    [SignalAvailability.AVAILABLE] (i.e. a C2PA manifest was cryptographically
 *    validated), its score *is* the result — it is not blended with probabilistic
 *    signals, matching "cryptographically verified provenance should be presented
 *    separately from probabilistic ML detection." This branch is unreachable in V1
 *    (the bundled C2PAProvider always reports UNAVAILABLE) but is implemented and
 *    tested now so enabling that provider later needs no engine changes.
 * 2. **Probabilistic blend** (the normal V1 path): a confidence-weighted average over
 *    every other AVAILABLE signal, using [EvidenceWeights]. Signals that are
 *    UNAVAILABLE or ERROR contribute nothing to the score — critically, an absent
 *    signal (e.g. no generator metadata found) never pushes the likelihood down,
 *    since absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
