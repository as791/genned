/**
 * One piece of evidence from one [com.genned.domain.provider.DetectionProvider].
 *
 * @param score AI-likelihood contribution in `[0, 1]`, or `null` when [availability]
 *   is not [SignalAvailability.AVAILABLE]. Never fabricate a value here — an
 *   unimplemented or inapplicable detector must report [SignalAvailability.UNAVAILABLE]
 *   with `score = null`.
 * @param confidence How much the provider itself trusts this particular reading
 *   (`[0, 1]`), independent of the score. Used by [com.genned.domain.evidence.EvidenceEngine]
 *   to down-weight shaky evidence (e.g. a classifier run on a very small image).
 * @param description Honest, user-facing summary. Must not overclaim — "No generator
 *   metadata found" rather than "Human-made".
 * @param evidence Optional raw detail (e.g. the literal EXIF string matched) shown in
 *   an expandable "why" section.
 * @param rawScore Optional detector-specific, uncalibrated evidence behind [score] (e.g. a
 *   classifier logit). Only used to combine several readings of the same detector before
 *   calibration, such as video frames; never shown, never persisted.
 * @param notable For a signal that is not AVAILABLE: something was found that the user
 *   should still see, even though it is not counted (e.g. Content Credentials from an
 *   unrecognized signer). Screens show notable signals instead of folding them away with
 *   the checks that simply had nothing to report.
